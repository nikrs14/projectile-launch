## How to use
This program was compiled on Pop!-OS 22.04, using `gcc`. You may have to recompile it in order to run the program. If that is the case, you must need the `SFML` library installed.

To shoot a projectile, point at some location with your mouse, and then press any mouse button.

To increase the launch speed, press `W`. To decrease it, press `S`

You can see the current launch speed on the top left corner.
